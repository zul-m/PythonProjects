## AUC and ROC

In Machine Learning, the AUC and ROC curve is used to measure the performance of a classification model by plotting the rate of true positives and the rate of false positives.

ROC stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. This is a graph that shows the performance of a machine learning model on a classification problem by plotting the true positive rate and the false positive rate. AUC stands for Area Under the Curve. It is used to measure the entire area under the ROC curve.

The ROC curve plots the true positive rate and the false positive rate at different classification thresholds, whereas the AUC shows an aggregate measure of the performance of a machine learning model across all the possible classification thresholds. You can learn more about the AUC and ROC curve in machine learning from [here](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/02/03/roc-and-auc-in-machine-learning/).

### AUC and ROC Curve using Python

I first train a machine learning model and then I plot the AUC and ROC curve using Python. Then, I train a classification model by using the [LightGBM Classifier](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/01/15/lightgbm-in-machine-learning/), calculate the ROC and AUC and then plot them by using the `matplotlib` library in Python.

The curve is known as the ROC curve and the area under the curve in the above figure is AUC. Whenever the AUC equals 1 then it is the ideal situation for a machine learning model.

### Summary

So this is how we can plot the AUC and ROC curve by using the Python programming language. The ROC curve represents the true positive rate and the false positive rate at different classification thresholds and the AUC represents the aggregate measure of the machine learning model across all possible classification thresholds.
