## Extract Text from Videos

In machine learning, Speech recognition is an interesting task that allows you to recognize the text behind the audio. With the use of voice recognition, we can also extract text from a video.

### Extract Text From Videos using Python

The first step is to download a video. After downloading the videos you need to install two Python libraries:
 1. `SpeechRecognition`: pip install SpeechRecognition 
 2. `moviepy`: pip install moviepy

After installing the above two Python libraries you can start with coding. Then, you need to create a text document to store all the text that has been extracted from the video.
