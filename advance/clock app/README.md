## Clock APP

We will build a simple Clock app with python using the `kivy` module in Python, similar in concept to the built-in application found in both iOS and Android using the Python Kivy language.

Let’s learn most of the Kivy by creating an application.

The important topics we will cover in this tutorial are as follows:
 • The basics of the Kivy language, a built-in domain-specific language (DSL) used to lay out widgets.
 • Styling (and eventually subclassing) built-in Kivy components.
 • Loading custom fonts and formatting text.
 • Scheduling and listening to events.

### Python Clock App with Kivy

Our finished program will only be about 60 lines long, split equally between a Python source code and a Kivy language (.kv) interface definition file.
