## Contact Book

A contact book is a database used to store entries related to a person’s contacts like a phone number, email address, etc. It is also known as the address book.

### Create a Contact Book using Python

Creating a contact book is a great project for someone who is at an intermediate level in Python. Somehow this follows the use of data structures and algorithms as we are going to add contacts to the book and find them using the person’s name.

So, creating a contacts book in Python will help you show and improve your coding skills a lot. When creating a contacts book with Python, you need to design an algorithm that allows the user to record and find any person’s details.

### Contact Book with Python

With a few modifications, you can use the code as a project where you can implement the same algorithm on a database like MySQL to store the contacts.

Note that you can save more information other than just contact details by customizing the code.

### Output
