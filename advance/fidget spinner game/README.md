## Fidget Spinner Game

The games are cool and everyone loves them. Making games can be very different from other types of programming.

### How To Create a Game?

As a programmer, when creating games you have to think more about the logic of the game. The logic of the game is the heart and soul of your game. It defines the game world, what things are in the universe and how they interact. It also defines how the state of the game can be altered by external stimuli, such as a human player pressing a button on the gamepad or an AI process taking action to kill you.

There are now so many programming languages that you can use to build a game. But the best choice is to use the C++ programming language.

### Create a Game with Python

I created a very simple game based on a fidget spinner. The logic of the game is that the turns will keep increasing as you press the space bar, and it will reduce its speed and stop at a point where you stop pressing the space bar.

To create a game with Python based on the above logic of a fidget spinner I am using the `Turtle` module in Python.

### Summary

So keep pressing the space bar to increase the speed and release the bar to slow down the speed.
