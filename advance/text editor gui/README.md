## Text Editor GUI

We need three important widgets to create the desired text editor GUI with Python; 2 button widgets to save and close, and a text box widget to create and edit text files. All the widgets should be arranged in a manner so that the buttons widgets are on the left side of the window layout and the text box widget is on the right side.

The entire window must have a minimum height of 800 pixels and the text box widget must have a minimum width of 800 pixels. The whole layout should be responsive so that if the window is resized, the text box widget is also resized.

I use the `Tkinter` package in Python to build a text editor GUI with Python.

### Text Editor GUI with Python

I simply start with importing the `Tkinter` package and by defining the variables with respective widgets that I discussed above. If you are using the `Tkinter` package for the first time you donâ€™t need to install this using any pip command, as this comes preinstalled in the Python Virtual environment.

If you run the code by using the `window.mainloop()` function the layout of our text editor GUI will be displayed.
