## Real-time Stock Price Data Visualization

You must have visited to check the stock prices of any company on Google and found a complete chart that represents the latest and the historical stock prices. You can also create such a real-time stock price data visualization system using Python where you will enter the name of a company and the stock prices data will be visualized as an output.

### Real-time Stock Price Data Visualization using Python

To create a realtime stock price data visualization application, I am using the [streamlit](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/03/19/streamlit-tutorial-using-python/) library in Python. In this task, we can use the `streamlit` library to create an interactive user interface where a user will enter the name of any company and the stock price data will be visualized as the final output.

For the task of visualizing stock prices, we can use any data visualization library in Python compatible with the `streamlit` framework. But to keep it simple, I am using the `matplotlib` library in Python.

Make sure that you run this Python code in an IDE or a code editor. To run your file just execute the **streamlit run filename.py** in your terminal. In the output, you will get to see a user interface.

Just write the name of any company in the user input. Make sure that you write the shortcut of the name of the company listed in the stock exchange.

### Summary

So this is how you can create a realtime stock price data visualization application using Python. You can use some more interactive tools provided by the `streamlit` framework to make your final application look more interactive.
