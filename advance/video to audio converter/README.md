## Video to Audio Converter

Converting Video to audio files is a smart tool to extract audio from video files. It might seem like an odd decision, but it can come in handy in specific cases. It is most often used to record the soundtrack of videos or to extract other audio tracks from videos where you are only interested in the sound.

If you think you can benefit from this possibility, you need an application to convert video to audio. Most importantly, you need to make sure that you choose the right one.

There are already apps that do this automatically for you. But creating such things that are already happening is what turns every coder on. Letâ€™s see how to convert video to audio using Python programming language.
