## Scrape Instagram

In this project, we will do scraping Instagram with Python. It is an easy task until you get errors in writing your usernames and passwords.

To scrap Instagram, we will use a library know as `instaloader` which provides us with an API for scraping Instagram. You can install this library by using the pip method in your terminal â€“

```py

### Scraping Instagram with Python

First of all, if you are learning Data Science then scraping Instagram will help you in getting the new trends of businesses, so that you can generate more leads and can reach out for your new potential customers. We start with scraping Instagram users profiles.

Then, we can extract some valuable information from an Instagram profile, and how you can log in to your Instagram profile using Python.

### Scraping Instagram Followers and Followees

Scraping your followers and followees will help you in getting a list of their usernames, which you will require to do when you will work in a professional environment in the data science field.

### Downloading Posts from Another Profile

Getting posts from any profile is easy in python. We just need to use `get_posts()`. I use this method on the profile of someone else. To download each post, we need to loop over the generator object using `.download_post()` method.

### Summary

It will save the post folder by creating its directory. In each folder, you will see the actual content of the posts of the profile like a video or images.
