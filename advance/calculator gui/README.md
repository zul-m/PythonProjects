## Calculator GUI

`Kivy` is a free, Open Source Python library that enables the rapid and easy development of highly interactive cross-platform applications. `Kivy`’s execution speed is the same as compared to the other mobile development alternatives like Java for Android and Objective C for iOS.

Additionally, `Kivy` has the huge advantage of being able to run on multiple platforms, just like HTML5 does; in this case, `Kivy` works best because it doesn’t rely on a heavy browser, and many of its components are implemented in C using the Cython library so that most of the graphics processing runs directly in the GPU.

`Kivy` offers an excellent balance of performance and portability in various hardware and software environments.

### Calculator GUI with Python

We don’t need to use any file named as file.kv for building a calculator, as a calculator is a very simple application.

### Summary

I hope you liked this project on how to build a simple calculator with the Python programming language.
