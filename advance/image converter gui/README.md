## Image Converter GUI

A large number of image file formats are available for storing graphic data, the most popular being JPG and PNG.

To create an Image converter GUI with Python, I use the `Tkinter` library in Python which is the best known Python framework for building GUI application. Other than `Tkinter` we also need `PIL` library in Python which stands for Python Imaging Library.

### Summary

This will work the same as all other applications installed in your system. You first need to select a PNG file then click on the button to convert PNG to JPG, then you just need to select a folder where you want to save your converted image.

This is how we can easily create a GUI application to convert Images.
