## Choropleth Map

A choropleth map is a shaded map where the intensity of the colour indicates the intensity or quantity of a particular feature. In Data Science, the choropleth maps are used to visualize the distribution of a feature in a geographical area.

For example, a world map that shows the regions of the maximum covid-19 cases for a particular month will be showing the regions with varying intensities of the blue colour. Here the dark blue colour will represent the highest affected areas by the covid-19, and the light blue colour will be representing the areas with comparatively fewer covid-19 cases.

### Choropleth Map using Python

Now letâ€™s see how to visualize a choropleth map using Python. For this task, I will be using the `plotly` library in Python. First, I will import the necessary Python libraries and the dataset that we need to visualize choropleth maps using Python.

The dataset that I am using here is based on the agricultural exports of the United States. Then, I visualize choropleth maps with this dataset using Python.

### Output

```
  code       state category  total exports   beef  pork  ...  veggies fresh  veggies proc  total veggies  corn  wheat   cotton
0   AL     Alabama    state        1390.63   34.4  10.6  ...            5.5           8.9          14.33  34.9   70.0   317.61

### Summary

So this is how you can visualize choropleth maps with Python by using the `Plotly` library in Python. There are more data visualization tools in Python that you can use for this task but to visualize a choropleth map `Plotly` library is best in my opinion.
