## Time Series Graph

A time-series graph is a [line plot](https://www.google.com/search?q=line%20plot&tbm=isch&tbs=rimg:CaP26XR4DKJcYYJo4WOOUfUtsgIGCgIIABAA&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN875IN875&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CAIQrnZqFwoTCKCg9rfZq_UCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAH&biw=1263&bih=569) that displays trends or patterns over a dataset collected over an interval of time. For example, when you visualize a line plot of the daily sales made by a business, you are visualizing a time-series graph. It is one of the most important data visualizations for every data scientist. So if you want to learn how to visualize it using Python, this project is for you.

### Time Series Graph

A time-series graph is a line plot used to visualize time series data. Time-series data is the data collected over an interval of time. Some of the popular examples of time series data are stock price data, daily sales data, daily covid cases data, etc.

While visualizing a time-series graph, the time intervals lie on the x-axis, and the data points collected over those time intervals lie on the y-axis. For example, while visualizing a time-series graph of stock price data, the date column will lie on the x-axis, and the price column will lie on the y-axis.

### Time Series Graph using Python

To visualize a time series graph using Python, I am using a stock price dataset. There are many libraries in Python for data visualization; I am using `Plotly` as it is easy to visualize interactive visualizations using plotly.
