## Get Live Covid-19 Data

Covid-19 is one of the topics you can work on in many unique data science projects. To work on any type of Covid-19 related project, you must work by using the latest dataset. So, if you want to learn how to get the latest covid-19 data using the Python programming language, this project is for you.

### Get Live Covid-19 Data using Python

To get live covid-19 data by using the Python programming language, it is very important for you to first learn about some of the popular methods of scraping data from the web. You can learn about web scraping using Python from [here](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/05/14/web-scraping-to-create-a-dataset-using-python/). Now coming back to get the latest covid-19 dataset, if you want to work on any project related to covid-19, it is very important to work on it by using the latest dataset as the cases are rising rapidly all around the world.

To get live covid-19 data using Python, I will be using the `BeautifulSoup` library in Python. If you have never used this library before then you can easily install it on your system by using the pip command.

```py
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

After executing the code, a new CSV file will be saved in the same directory where your Python file is located as “Dataset.csv”. This dataset requires some preparation before you start using it in any type of data science project. For example, you can change the name of its columns.

### Summary

So this is how you can get the latest dataset about covid-19 cases and store it in a CSV file. If you want to work on any project related to covid-19, it is very important to work on it by using the latest dataset as the cases are rising rapidly all around the world.
