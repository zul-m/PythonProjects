## Weight Converter GUI

Weight conversion means to multiply the value of a unit with the standard conversion value. The standard weight conversion values include:
 1. 1 milligram = 0.001 gram
 2. 1 centigram = 0.01 gram
 3. 1 decigram = 0.1 gram
 4. 1 kilogram = 1000 grams
 5. 1 gram = 1000 milligrams
 6. 1 ton = 2000 pounds
 7. 1 pound = 16 ounces

### Weight Converter GUI with Python

I use the `Tkinter` library in Python for this task.
