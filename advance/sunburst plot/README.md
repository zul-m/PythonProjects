## Sunburst Plot

Sunburst plot is an amazing visualization technique used to visualize hierarchical data. It extends radially outward from the root to the leaves to visualize hierarchical data. If you’ve never used sunburst charts before to visualize your dataset, this project is for you.

A sunburst plot is a very popular data visualization technique used to visualize hierarchical data where each level of the hierarchy is represented by a ring or circle where the innermost circle or ring is the highest level of the hierarchy. Sunburst charts are best to be used when analyzing a dataset where the output of a variable can be split into multiple factors.

You can visualize a sunburst plot with any data visualization tool like Tableau, Microsoft Excel, or Python libraries like `Plotly`.

### Sunburst Plot using Python

To visualize sunburst plots, I’ll be using the `plotly` library in Python. So if you’ve never used it before, you can easily install it on your system using the pip command.

```py
pip install plotly
```

### Summary

So this is how you can easily visualize sunburst plots using Python. Always remember to only use sunburst plots on a hierarchical dataset, otherwise, it will look like a [donut plot](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/12/16/donut-plot-with-python/). A sunburst plot is a very popular data visualization technique used to visualize hierarchical data where each level of the hierarchy is represented by a ring or circle where the innermost circle or ring is the highest level in the hierarchy.
