## Visualize a Chess Board

A chessboard is the type of game board used for the game of chess, on which pawns and chess pieces are placed. A chessboard is usually square, with an alternating pattern of squares of two colours.

### Create a Chessboard with Python

To create a chessboard with the Python programming language, I use two Python libraries; `Matplotlib` for visualization, and `NumPy` for building an algorithm which will help us to create and visualize a chessboard.

### Summary

So this is how we can create and visualize a chessboard with code.
