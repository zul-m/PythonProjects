## Violin Plot

A violin plot is used to visualize and compare the distribution of quantitative data over several levels of categorical features. It is very useful to visualize several distributions in a dataset at a time. If you donâ€™t know how to visualize violin plots using the Python programming language, this project is for you.

A violin plot is a combination of a boxplot and a probability density function plot. It allows us to analyze:
 1. data distribution
 2. its degree of dispersion
 3. type of probability distribution
 4. the shape of the probability distribution

Violin plots are often compared to boxplots because they both have many similarities. Violin plots are preferred over box plots because they can also visualize the probability density function of a dataset at different values. So the violin plots are more useful and efficient than any other data visualization technique used for visualizing the distribution of a dataset, but they are still not very popular.

You can use any [data visualization library](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/11/03/python-libraries-for-data-visualization/) in Python to visualize the violin plots such as `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Plotly`. For this project, I'm using the `Seaborn` library to visualize violin plots using Python.

### Violin Plot using Python

In the code, we are visualizing a single violin plot. Then, we visualize multiple violin plots grouped based on the categorical features of the dataset.

### Summary

So this is how you can visualize the violin plots using the `Seaborn` library in Python. They are used to visualize and compare the distribution of quantitative data over several levels of categorical characteristics. They are also very useful for viewing multiple distributions in a dataset at a time.
