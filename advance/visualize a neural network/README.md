## Visualize a Neural Network

You must have used a neural network for training a model on your data. There are so many [types](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/05/20/types-of-neural-networks/) of architectures of neural networks that you can use to train a model, but have you ever visualized the architecture of a neural network? If you want to learn how to visualize a neural network, this project is for you.

### How to Visualize a Neural Network?

There are many tools you can use for visualizing the architecture of a neural network. Some of the best tools for visualizing a neural network are:
 1. Net2Vis
 2. VisualKeras
 3. drawconvent
 4. NNSVG
 5. PlotNeuralNet
 6. Tensorboard
 7. Graphviz
 8. TensorSpace

This project is how to visualize neural networks with `Visualkeras` using the Python programming language.

### Visualize a Neural Network using Python

Before visualizing the architecture of a neural network, we must first design a neural network. Then, after designing the architecture of a neural network, the next task is to install the visualkeras library in your system. You can easily install it by using the pip command.

```py
pip install visualkeras
```

### Summary

This is how we can easily visualize the architecture of neural networks using the programming language Python. Hope this project helps you to design and visualize some interesting neural networks and hope you will explore the architecture of more neural networks.
