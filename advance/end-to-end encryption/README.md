## End-to-End Encryption

End-to-end encryption is a system that ensures that only the users involved in the communication can understand and read the messages. Many applications use end-to-end encryption to protect their users’ data. So, if you want to know how to protect your messages with end-to-end encryption using Python, this project is for you.

### What is End-to-End Encryption?

End-to-end encryption is a communication system that ensures that only users involved in a particular communication can only read and understand messages. It is done by many applications to protect the data of their users. Some of the most popular applications that are end-to-end encrypted are:
 1. WhatsApp
 2. Viber
 3. Line
 4. Telegram 
 5. KakaoTalk
 6. Signal
 7. Dust

These are just a few of the popular apps that are end-to-end encrypted for their users. So, securing user data using end-to-end encryption is nothing new, it has been used by many applications for a long time. 

There is no defined way of end-to-end encryption that you can use to secure user data. All companies have their own defined algorithm to keep their applications end-to-end encrypted.

### End-to-End Encryption using Python

To implement end-to-end encryption using Python, I first define two Python functions to determine if the length of a message is odd or even.

Then, I define a Python function to swap the letters of the message between them, here if the length of the letters in the message will be odd then we will add an extra letter to the message as “x”.

Now I test this end-to-end encryption system by creating an end-to-end application using the `streamlit` library.

As we are using the `streamlit` library here, so to run your code use the command in your terminal mentioned below.

```ps1
streamlit run filename.py
```

After running this command, you will see your output in the form of a web application.

### Summary

So this is how you can do end-to-end encryption by using the Python programming language. It is a communication system that ensures that only users involved in a particular communication can only read and understand messages. It is done by many applications to protect the data of their users.
