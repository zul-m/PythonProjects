## Unicode Characters Removal

Unicode Characters can be defined as the smallest component of any language that has a semantic value. They are the combination of special values which represents special characters.

In computer science, Unicode characters are special characters that are not part of any language. But still, they are used as part of a text, especially to represent our emotions in a message. There are 143,859 Unicode characters which are divided into the categories mentioned below:
 1. Alphanumeric Variants
 2. Enclosed Variants
 3. Arrows
 4. Mathematical
 5. Technical
 6. Musical
 7. Games
 8. Emotions
 9. and Miscellaneous

The Unicode characters contain the alphabets of almost all the known languages. The Unicode standard encodes the characters in the range u+0000 and u+10FFF. For example, the Unicode standard of the happy emoji ‚ÄúüòÉ‚Äù that we use while chatting is ‚ÄúU+1F603‚Äù.

### Summary

We need to remove Unicode characters while working on natural language processing applications as it is part of text data processing. You can use the code for removing the Unicode characters from any piece of text. It is important to clean the special characters as if not cleaned then it will affect the accuracy of your machine learning model.
