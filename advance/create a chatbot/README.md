## Create a Chatbot

A Chatbot is an AI application that mimics human conversations. It is widely used by companies to solve the most common problems they receive from customers daily. For example, if you want to know the CRN of your bank account, a chatbot will assist you by asking for your bank details, then it will give you your CRN. But if you want to know something that is not that common, like asking how you can turn your account into a joint account, chances are the authorized employee will assist you.

So while creating a chatbot for any company you should know what that company deals in and what problems their customers get daily.

### Chatbot with Python

I will be using the `NLTK` library in Python which is one of the best Python libraries for any task of natural language processing, and create a list of queries and their responses for the chatbot. Then, I will run the program and interact with the chatbot by using some of the queries related to the queries mentioned in the list.

You can create the chatbot more advanced by using some more Python packages of NLP or by adding more queries to it.

### Output

```
Hi, I'm zul-m and I like to chat.
Please type here to start a conversation. Type quit to leave.
>whats your name
My name is zul-m, but you can just call me robot and I'm a chatbot.
>hey there
Hey there
>how are you
That is nice to hear
>can you please sing a song to me
That is nice to hear
>quit
Bye for now. See you soon :)
```

### Summary

Chatbots are very useful applications for every company especially if a company is providing any type of service. It helps an organization by solving the most common queries of the customers.
