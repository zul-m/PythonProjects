## Radar Plot

A radar plot is also known as a spider plot or a star plot. It is used to display multivariate data as a two-dimensional visualization of quantitative features that are represented on axes coming from the centre.

Radar charts are used to make comparisons between different observations. For example, if you want to compare the cost of producing, selling, and promoting a product, you can use a radar chart. The purpose of viewing data in a radar plot is to analyze a graph of values over multiple features.

To create a Radar plot, we need to give an axis to each feature in a way that all the axis are present radically around the centre. Then we plot the data on each axis like a scatter plot but the points of the plot connect in a way that creates a polygon.

In short, they are used to visualize multivariate data as a two-dimensional graph of quantitative characteristics.

### Summary

So this is how we can visualize a Radar graph with the Python programming language by using the plotly library in Python. This graph is used for drawing comparisons between multiple observations.
