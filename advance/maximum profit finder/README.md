## Maximum Profit Finder

Finding the maximum profit while buying and selling stocks in the stock market is a great question for coding interviews at companies based on financial services. Here you are given an array of stock prices and transaction fees and what you have to do is calculate the maximum profitable amount.

### Find Maximum Profit: Problem Statement

Maximum Profit Finder is a good question for coding interviews. Here you are given an array or a list of stock prices of a particular day and an integer value that represents the transaction fees. Here you have to write an algorithm to find the maximum profit that you can achieve such that you can do as many transactions you want and you need to pay the transaction fees for each transaction that you do. Below is the problem statement that you get in the coding interviews to find the maximum profit.

*You are given a list of stock prices of a particular day. You need to write an algorithm to find the maximum profit that you can achieve at most two transactions.*

### Find Maximum Profit using Python

We have to take a recursive approach to solve this problem because first, we have to check if we have already bought stocks or not. If we have already bought stocks then we can sell them at the current price including the transaction fees and if we do not have bought stocks then we can buy the stocks at the current price.

Then, we implement the algorithm to find the most profitable amount while buying or selling stocks with transaction fees.

### Output

```

### Summary

So this is how we can solve the problem of finding the most profitable amount while buying or selling stocks with a transaction fee. This is a good interview question at companies based on financial services.
