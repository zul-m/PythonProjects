## Convert Image to an Array

We need to convert an image to an array to use it for any kind of data science task where we need to understand the features of an image. Converting images to an array is as easy as converting text to numeric data. So, if you want to learn how to convert images to an array, then this project is for you.

### How to Convert an Image to Array using Python?

Converting an image to an array is an important task to train a machine learning model based on the features of an image. We mainly use the `NumPy` library in Python to work with arrays so we can also use it to convert images to an array. First we need to use the `PIL` library in Python to read an image. If youâ€™ve never used it before, you can easily install it using the pip command.

```py
pip install Pillow
```

Other than `NumPy`, we can also use the `Keras` library in Python for the same task.

### Summary

So this is how we can easily convert images to an array by using the Python programming language. Converting an image to an array is an important task to train a machine learning model based on the features of an image.
