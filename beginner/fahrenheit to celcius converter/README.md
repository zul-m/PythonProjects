## Fahrenheit to Celcius Converter

Most countries around the world use the Celsius scale to indicate temperatures, but the United States still uses the Fahrenheit scale. In this project, I will take you through a very simple program for beginners to convert Fahrenheit to celsius with Python programming language.

### Python Program To Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius

Calculating temperature conversion is simple. We have to convert the temperature because Celsius and Fahrenheit have different starting points; 0 degrees Celsius is 32 degrees Fahrenheit. So to convert Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius, we just need to subtract 32 from the temperature Fahrenheit.

Sometimes the size of the units is also different. Celsius divides the temperature range between the freezing and boiling points of water is 100 degrees, while Fahrenheit divides this range into 180 degrees, so I will also multiply the value by 5/9 to convert 180 degrees into 100.

### Output

```
Enter temperature in fahrenheit: 78
25.555555555555557
```

### Summary

So this is how we can convert temperatures with Python programming language.
