## Treemap

A treemap is a data visualization technique used to visualize hierarchical data using nested rectangles. A treemap displays hierarchical data in such a way that each branch of the tree receives a rectangle which is filled with smaller rectangles as sub-branches.

### Visualizing a Treemap using Python

There are so many data visualization libraries in Python that we can use for visualizing treemaps, but the easiest way is to use the `plotly` library in Python.

### Summary
